# TwoSigma Rental Listing Inquiries

This Kaggle competition provided entrants with information provided by TwoSigma regarding online rental listings.  The goal is to accurately predict the interest level in each rental simply based off of the information found in the listing itself.  This was a fun exercise in feature engineering; there is a significant amount of data that can be extracted from any online advertisement, let alone one for apartment listings in New York City.  In the end, I ended up with approximately 130 different feature variables from an original listing that included 13 fields; that number could've easily exceeded 200, but due to computational/processing limitations of my hardware, that simply wasn't feasible.  Even with that constrainment, a single modeling algorithm took several hours to train.  Nevertheless, it was a useful exercise in best machine learning practices where efficiency is sometimes preferred to maximizing accuracy.
